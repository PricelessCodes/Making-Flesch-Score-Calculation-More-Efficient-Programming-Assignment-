Data Structures and Performance University of California San Diego Course from Coursera.

Improving and Measuring Program Efficiency

In this assignment, weâ€™ll optimize the implementation of the Document class that you implemented in your last assignment, and then measure how much faster your new implementation is.

Assignment Instructions

This assignment has two parts.  The instructions below tell you how to produce the files you need to upload for a grade in each part.

Part 1: Complete the Implementation of EfficientDocument

1. Implement processText() in EfficientDocument.java.

This method should make ONE pass through the tokens list and count the number of words, sentences and syllables in the document.  It should store these values in the appropriate member variables so that when the method is over, they never have to be re-calculated.

You should make sure you understand the provided method getTokens, isWord, and the provided first line of code in the processText method.  

IMPORTANT: Notice that countSyllables and isWord do not use Matcher objects or regular expressions.  This is important.  It turns out that the process of creating a Pattern and a Matcher object for each word is slow enough that if you take this approach your EfficientDocument will end up being slower than your BasicDocument, because of the overhead of creating and destroying objects in memory.  So use the single regex we provide at the start of the processText method, but don't try to use Patterns or Matchers on the individual tokens returned from the first call to getTokens.

2. Implement getNumWords, getNumSyllables, and getNumSentences in EfficientDocument.java

Once you have implemented the processText method, the implementations of these three methods is trivial.

You can again use the method testCase in the Document class to test the correctness of your implementation.  We've provided a few test cases for you.  You should add more.

Part 2:  Benchmarking

Your next task is to determine and plot how much faster EfficientDocument is than BasicDocument in computing a single Flesch score for a document. 

1. Calculate the Big-O running time of your code to compute the Flesch score for BasicDocument and EfficientDocument (including the time taken by processText!) and predict how the running time of calling fleschScore on  BasicDocument and EfficientDocument will grow as the document size grows.  

2. Open the file DocumentBenchmarking.java, which you can find in the document package.  You will be adding code to the main method, and you will find the method getStringFromFile useful for reading a specified number of characters from a text file.

3. Complete the main method so that it prints a table with one column each for the amount of time it takes to create a BasicDocument or an EfficientDocument, respectively, and call fleschScore on it.  Your table should look like the following:

NumberOfChars        BasicTime              EfficientTime

5000               [basic time 1]          [efficient time 1]

10000              [basic time 2]          [efficient time 2]

15000              [basic time 3]          [efficient time 3]

...

Where the first column in the table prints the number of characters in the test, the second column is the amount of time it takes to create a BasicDocument with that many characters and call fleschScore on it, and the third column is the amount of time it takes to create an EfficientDocument with that many characters and call fleschScore on it.  In these timing calculations, you should include the time taken by both constructors (i.e. the time EfficientDocument takes
 calculating the number of words, syllables and sentences in the 
document), otherwise it's not a fair 
comparison at all!

Columns in the table should be separated with a \t character for easy copy and paste in the next section.  You can also write this table to a file if you want, but it's not necessary.

4. Plot your results and compare them to your predictions.  Copy the output of your program and paste it into a Google spreadsheet (sheets.google.com).  It should automatically paste into 3 columns.  Then, graph the data using the Explore button in the lower right corner, as shown in the image below.

Do your results look like what you expected them to?  If not, consider whether you've done something wrong in your code somewhere and try to fix it.  But remember that empirical tests always have some noise, so some deviations from "perfect" data are expected.  

 **To better understand your results, we strongly encourage you to discuss your results on the discussion forum**

Working with real data is fun, but is best done when you have someone else to talk about it with to make sure you really understand what's going on.
